    "\n",
    "Hashing is an important component of the modern digital world. Its extensive use has multiple applications but most importantly allows secure network communications, builds trust between users, organisations, governments and enables a smooth delivery of many interactions of the society. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the hashing applications in day-to-day life and technology are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Password verification and message digestion: Web sites verify the user's identity by storing and comparing the hashed version of a password without the need of storing the actual password which would come with high risks. Another example the cryptographic algorithm can digest a chunk of data (e.g. a contract or a ledger) and produce signatures. A common application is the cryptographic component of the cryptocurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programming languages' data structures: Hashing data structures are used by computers to perfrorm operations like  comparison or identification of duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we would expect from a cryptographic algorithm (CA)\n",
    "<a id=\"expect\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "An 'ideal' CA should have some essential properties. By principal, CAs have to be one-way. That means that one can easily produce an output of specific length $L$ (hash value) from an input but it should be very difficult to reverse the function and produce the initial message from the output. Another property that a CA should have is that for a minor alteration on the input message, the hashed value should change drastically<sup>[[1]](#ref)</sup> (Avalanche effect). Finally, for an 'ideal' CA it should be difficult to identify two different inputs that result into the same hash value. Although it's possible that two messages have the same hash value<sup>[[2]](#ref)</sup> (Pigeonhole principle), this is not something likely to occur 'naturally' (without effort). In terms of message digesting, a CA has to have a 'balanced' speed. This means that it has to be fast enough for a user to digest big documents but slow enough to discourage brute-force attacks. For example, a CA to be used for hashing passwords should be slower than one used for larger message digestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the term 'difficult' mentioned above is quite abstract, the effort required to compromise the two essential characteristics of an ideal CA that can be expressed mathematically. It should take $2^{L/2}$ attempts to find two messages($M$ and $M'$) that generate the same hash value (collision-free property) and for a known $M$ should take $2^L$ attempts to find a $M'$ that has the same hash value (preimage property).\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the assumption that such a CA wouldn't have any weaknesses, it would only be possible to undermine its integrity by brute-force. This means that the attacker should try all the possible combinations to either compromise the 'one-way' or 'collision-free' property of the function. A CA will be considered functional as long as an attack requires a disproportional amount of time and resources (computational power).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Vulnerablility and types of attacks \n",
    "<a id=\"vul\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "A CA would be considered vulnerable when it is worth the attacker's time and resources to compromise one of its properties. Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An attack to the collision-free property would be practical when the attacker can identify a $M$ and $M'$ with the same hash with less that $2^{L/2}$ attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An attack to the one-way property would be possible when the attacker can either:\n",
    "    - Find a $M$ for a known hash value in less that $2^L$ attempts (first preimage attack)\n",
    "    - For a known $M$ find a $M'$ with the same hash value in less than $2^L$ attempts (second preimage attack)\n",
    "    \n",
    " \n",
    "## Which type of attack would have a more catastrophic impact\n",
    "<a id=\"catast\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The lifecycle of a CA comes into and end when its properties are no longer valid. Although, the 'collision-free' characteristic of a CA is important, the preimage attacks could be devastating for the reputation and the security an algorithm can provide. By definition, in a collision attack scenario the attacker is free to choose between two random messages that share a common hash value ($2^{L/2}$ attempts required). In the second preimage attack scenario, the task is to find a message that its key matches the one of an already known message (a more difficult task with complexity $2^L$). If the attacker finds a 'practical' way to achieve this then the function ceases to be one-way. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two attacks might have similarities but are different concept-wise. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when an attacker has the freedom to forge two contracts with the same signature, they can use the two documents interchangeably on his favour to perform a fraud. This would be a collision attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a different case, when an attacker wills to forge a signature for a given message, the second preimage is of great importance. The task is much harder as it requires finding an identical signature for a given data message.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the nature of the examples above we could come up with two conclusions: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "- A second preimage is essentially a version of collision that is harder to solve. If the second preimage resistance of a CA is compromised, then the collision resistance is compromised as well (but not the other way around). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the second preimage is attacked, the impact would be far more devastating as a great range of protocols and certificates will be affected. In this case, the one-way property of a CA is completely eliminated and the function is considered completely broken. \n",

    "## Broken CAs (MD2)\n",
    "<a id=\"brok\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking in to the IETF's<sup>[[3]](#ref)</sup> 'Request for Comments'<sup>[[4]](#ref)</sup> (a memorandum on Internet standards), one can gain some good understanding about the introduction and the end of life of the MD2 algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "In [August 1989](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1115) MD2 was introduced by Ron Rivest (RSA<sup>[[7]](#ref)</sup>) for use on  privacy-enhanced electronic mail.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In [April 2002](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3279) were expressed some concerns about the integrity of the algorithm as the checksum operation was the only obstacle for a succesful attack. Thus it was recommended that MD2 could be still used to verify existing signatures, as the ability to find collisions in MD2 would not enable an  attacker to find new messages having a previously computed hash value. It was also recommended that the algorithm shouldn't be used in new applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a [March 2011](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6149#ref-KMM2010) RFC a preimage attack of $2^{73}$ complexity was confirmed<sup>[[5]](#ref)</sup>. The MD2 was not one-way anymore and shouldn't be used for digital signatures. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the basic concepts that is making attacks feasible is the birthday paradox<sup>[[6]](#ref)</sup>. Based on the statistical fact that the attempts needed to compromise a CA property are less than just using brute force, the attackers were able to apply several scenarios to make MD2 invertible. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, an attack might not be computationally practical but still can reveal weaknesses of cryptographic algorithm. As noted by Bruce Schneier<sup>[[12]](#ref)</sup>, if an algorithm is proved to be attacked in fewer attempts than brute force, it is still considered as broken even if this attack is not possible in practice.\n",

    "# Different types of algorithms and their use cases (PBKDF2 and sha256)\n",
    "<a id=\"types_alg\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several hashing algorithms developed over the years with each one having the same properties but different design and characteristics. In this section we will see how PBKDF2 and SHA-256 are different from each other and why they perform better in different tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "PBKDF2 comes from RSA's 'Public-Key Cryptography Standards'<sup>[[8]](#ref)</sup> (PKCS) series. As it was stated in [RFC 2898](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2898.txt), since passwords were often chosen from a relatively small space *(users tend to select similar common words as passwords. Additionally, passwords are usually relatively short)*, special care was required from the cryptographic operations to defend against search attacks. The main focus of PBKDF2 is to generate a hash version of passwords since the cryptosystems cannot store directly passwords.       \n",
    "\n",
    "The two main characteristics of PBKDF2 are:\n",
    "     \n",
    "   _**a)** Incorporates a 'salt value'<sup>[[9]](#ref)</sup>(password hashes use a salt so that identical passwords won't map to the same hash)_ \n",
    "   \n",
    "   _**b)** It is by design slower in comparison to other algorithms. For example, for a sample run of 40 hashes, using a Linux Mint 64 bit operating system on a Core i5 3340M at 2.7GHz, the SHA-256  performs 126,323 hashes per second when PBKDF2 performs only 5,026<sup>[[10]](#ref)</sup>_\n",
    "   \n",
    "   _**c)** Incorporates an adjustable  [work factor](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/work_factor)._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The SHA-256  belongs to the SHA-2 family of algorithms with digest of 256 bits. SHA-2 was first published by the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov) (NIST) as a Federal Information Processing. SHA-256 is commonly used when the input message is relatively large. For example, Linux distribution operating systems (like Debian) are using SHA-256 to authenticate packages<sup>[[11]](#ref)</sup>. Another common application is on cryptocurrencies. The main characteristics of SHA-256. SHA-256 compared to PBKDF2:\n",
    "\n",
    "   _**a)** Does not have a salt value (although a similar effect can be achieved by prepending the salt to the input message)_ \n",
    "   \n",
    "   _**a)** It's fast by design_\n",
    "   \n",
    "Generally, from the use cases for each algorithm we can see that in the PBKDF2 case the resulting output isn't used as key but as hash value and it's also called a password hash. It is different from SHA-256 as it contains a salt value and a work factor. The salt value and the slowness of PBKDF2 makes it more resistant to brute force attacks, using a [dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack) of common passwords, or using a [rainbow table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) (a pre-compiled list of hash values). On the other hand side, the SHA-256 is used by Bitcoin for verifying transactions and calculating proof of work. Because of its speed, SHA-256 can provide a good balance of collision-avoidance and performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from all the methodological aspects of each type of attacks, it is also useful to take into account their requirements in terms of resources<sup>[[13]](#ref)</sup>. Three major parameters that play an important role in the efficiency of an algorithm are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The computational steps for the attack\n",
    "\n",
    "- The required memory storage\n",
    "\n",
    "- The length of the input message and the hash value\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters along with the particularity of each algorithm (i.e., speed) make the evaluation of characterising  an attack feasible a difficult task. In the field of cryptanalysis, the order of the magnitude for an attack might be summarised in a single number (e.g. $2^L$) but how practical such an attack is would depend on other factors as well. One of the main concerns is how much the increase in computer power (according to Gordon Moore<sup>[[18]](#ref)</sup> \"The number of transistors incorporated in a chip will approximately double every 24 months.\") enables criminal activity against cryptography. Apart from the increased access to supercomputing that is now possible through the cloud services, it is also investigated how quantum computers will affect security in the future (Fred Pipe<sup>[[14]](#ref)</sup>).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since cryptography lies in the heart of cryptocurrency as a mean for distributing trust through the concept of proof of work, there is also an environmental issue raised. Proof of work is very demanding in terms of renewable energy and consequently has an impact to climate change via the carbon emissions produced. To tackle this problem, some cryptocurrencies introduced the concept of proof of stake as an alternative to proof of work. Although proof of stake has significantly less requirements in terms of energy, there is a debate on whether the distributed trust concept is compromised under the assumption that more wealthy miners will be able to earn more.\n",
